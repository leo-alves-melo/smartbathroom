# smartbathroom

## Intel IoT Roadshow - 2015

## Project
This project aims to develop a “smart” bathroom making use of relevant capacity utilization data, 
such as: people flow during a pre-established time interval; facility utilization data (number of visitors 
versus time they stayed in the bathroom), and, according to the physical space utilization rate, trigger 
“on demand” cleaning process alert (via Twitter). This kind of technological solution can be applied in 
areas with intense flow of people, such as hospital hallways, restaurants, museums and similar ones. 
As result, a better cleaning team dimensioning is expected, which leads to optimization of resources utilization.
